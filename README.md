# Unity Lander
Small project built in Unity. The main focus was to emulate the mechanics of Atari's game Lander. I wanted the rocket thrust to work without using any physics and only direction formulas. The rocket goes "up" when you press space.

# What I learned
* How to emulate gravity without using the physics engine
* Enum structure
